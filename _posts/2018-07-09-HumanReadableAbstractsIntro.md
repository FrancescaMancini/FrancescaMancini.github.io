*Let’s face it, scientific papers are not written for a general audience. As much as we try to avoid it, they are full or jargon and aimed at scientists. This makes science inaccessible to a big part of the population, because our results are difficult to understand and sometimes just plain boring to read. This is why I have decided to launch “Human readable abstracts”, a series of blog posts to communicate my science to a wider audience.* 

The idea for this series of blog posts came to me a while ago, when I was thinking about what **open access** in science really means. Sure, publishing articles that are not locked behind a paywall is the first step in that direction, but open access fees can be very expensive. An alternative, which is what I usually do with my papers, is to publish a **preprint** of the article (the draft that is going to be submitted to the journal) before sending it for publication, or a **postprint** (the revised version after peer review) after acceptance of the article by a journal. The advantage of the **preprint** compared to the **postprint** is that your research can get out into the world a lot sooner and start receiving feedback. 

I am a huge fan of **preprints**, but **is a preprint enough to make my science accessible?** Scientific papers, even if freely downloadable, may still be inaccessible to people outside your field of research or, if you are a very good science writer, to people who are not scientists. Scientific publications can be very long and are written in a style that is often quite boring; we try to avoid using jargon, but there are certain concepts that we assume every scientist will be familiar with (for example statistical concepts). **You should not need to have a science degree to be able to read about science.** 

Sure, there are professional journalists whose job it is to communicate other people’s research, but sometimes findings can be reported incorrectly as accuracy is sacrificed to make a headline. Plus, I like the idea of communicating my own research regardless of whether my results are interesting enough for the press. The ability to express complex concepts to a generic audience is a very valuable skill that every scientist should be trained in. Unfortunately the majority of us are not. With the blog posts series *Human readable abstracts* I will try to improve my communication skills and expand the reach of my research to anyone who is interested in sustainability and nature conservation, independently from your education qualifications. 

I hope you will enjoy reading about my research and keep an eye on this space, the first human readable abstract will be live soon!
