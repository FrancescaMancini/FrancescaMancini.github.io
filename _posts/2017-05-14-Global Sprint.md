I am so excited to announce that Aberdeen will be one of the host sites for the [Mozilla Global Sprint 2017](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/)!
This is a fun, fast-paced and two-day collaborative event to hack and build projects for a healthy Internet. 
A diverse network of scientists, educators, artists, engineers and others come together in person and online to innovate in the open. You can bring your own project or browse [this list](https://github.com/mozilla/global-sprint/issues) of awesome projects and pick one or two to work on during the Sprint. Projects range from computer games to developing teaching material, so there is something for everybody. You can contribute with:

*	Code or content
*	QA (quality assurance) testing on prototype tools or apps
*	proofreading or writing, visual design and graphic art
*	advising or commenting on project ideas or plans from your own unique perspective…

In Aberdeen we will meet on the 1st and 2nd of June from 9 am to 5 pm in Room 250, [Mac Robert Building](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/MacRobert+Building,+Aberdeen+AB24/@57.1662432,-2.100484,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48840e0ef1cd)f9e1:0x2d5f64fdb009b49c!8m2!3d57.1662744!4d-2.0982479). All you need to do is register for the event at [this link](https://ti.to/Mozilla/global-sprint-aberdeen) and bring your laptop. The event is free and we will provide coffee and cake! 
All skill levels are welcome and you don’t have to commit to being at the entire Sprint– drop in for two hours or two days, whatever works for you! If you are not sure how you can contribute or have any questions, just email me at r03fm14@abdn.ac.uk.
