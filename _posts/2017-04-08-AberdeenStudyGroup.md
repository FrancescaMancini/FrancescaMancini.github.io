[AberdeenStudy Group](https://aberdeenstudygroup.github.io/studyGroup/) is a fun, informal meetup of friends and colleagues to share skills, stories and ideas on using code for research, and exploring open research practices.
The goal is to create a friendly, no-pressure environment where people can share their work, ask for help on a coding problem, and learn and work together with their peers. Everyone is welcome, especially beginners! 


### Who we are

We are a group of students, researchers and academics who code. We all work in different fields, but we are all passionate about open science, reproducible research, sharing skills, cake and pub nights! 


### Who should join

This group is for everyone who uses code in their research and for those who would like to, but donâ€™t know how to code yet. It is a group for everyone who wants to share their skills and those who want to learn something new. 
It is the place where you can go when you have been stuck on that coding issue for days and you need help and the place where you can share how you finally fixed it.
This group is for all the open science champions in Aberdeen, for those who would like to become one (but learning the tools is just too time consuming on your own) and for those who are not entirely sure what open science means.


### What we do

We meet regularly every week. Sometimes someone will show us how to use a new tool, sometimes we just work together at our own projects asking each other questions. We always work in a collaboratively and friendly way, try to learn from each other and sometimes we just go to the pub.
